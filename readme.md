## ðŸ“„ What is Page Object Model (POM)?

POM is a design pattern that creates an object repository for web UI elements. It helps make your test code more readable, reusable, and maintainable by separating page structure from test logic.

In this project:

- All selectors and actions for the login page are in `LoginPage.ts`.
- Tests interact with the `LoginPage` class, not directly with locators.
